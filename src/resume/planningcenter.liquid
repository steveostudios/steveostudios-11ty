resumeBio: I love creating tools, spaces, and experiences that communicate the Gospel clearly. I am passionate about the power of discipleship. I believe that church services can be fun, inviting, and that the message sticks better if people feel loved, welcomed, and connected. I enjoy thinking deeply about problems, the thrill of live production, and creating sustainable systems.
