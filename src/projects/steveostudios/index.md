## Overview

The site you're on right now!

I've had some sort of portfolio site since 2003 or so. Boy, that feels weird to say! It's been built and rebuilt as I grow as a developer, as I discover new techniques I want to explore, and figure out what I want to tell the world.

In the past, I've struggled with keeping things updated, much less adding new content! I've found a secret sauce, at least for now, that is easy to update and flexible!

The site features posts going back to me learning Cinema 4D in 2010. I regularly update it with my reading progress (I like to read, what can I say?!). As well as this section, which is my best attempt at collecting some of the projects that I have worked on. There is even my [resume](/resume), if you're interested.

## Behind the Scenes

This current iteration is built on Eleventy, hosted on Netlify. I like this because it's super fast and easy to manage. When I push to `main` my site us deployed within a couple minutes thanks to Netlify. It's static, fast, and secure.

## Past iterations

- Macromedia Flash
- Apple iWeb (Mobile Me)
