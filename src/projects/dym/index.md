## Overview

Download Youth Ministry is an E-Commerce website that takes in product submissions from youth workers, and cleans and edits them, and then sells them. The author makes a percentage. DYM also has a pretty incredible membership program that offers almost matched store credit to the membership fee, discounts in the store, and access to some pretty neat tools for youth workers (like [Sidekick](/projects/sidekick)). We release dozens of products a week.

## Behind the Scenes

Download Youth Ministry has been through some changes. I was part of the original MVP, when it was built on WooCommerce and Wordpress. I got to build the author dashboard, which helped authors know how well their resources were helping other youth workers. We also launched the membership program back then.

DYM's site then went through a phase in Magento, which I had pretty minimal involvement in. At the time I was focused on Newsletter, DYM Games, [Sidekick](/projects/sidekick), and our Pipeline app.

Finally, we rebuilt the entire site in SalesForce Commerce Cloud. My involvement started with only getting the API to work with our membership apps. After launch we had significant issues and my role changed to diagnosing and fixing things that were poorly handled by our original systems integrator. I mainly handled helping our new SI with troubleshooting and acting as a translator for the team, but also solved a few tickets as well.
