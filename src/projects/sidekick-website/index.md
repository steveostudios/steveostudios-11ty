## Overview

This site is the landing page for [Sidekick](/projects/sidekick), the presentation app we built at DYM. It serves as the primary means to offer training, download links, as well as an API for notifications in the app itself.

Fun fact, I recorded, edited, and am the voice you hear in all of the videos!

## Behind the Scenes

The site is a Wordpress landing page hosted on FlyWheel. The pages on the front-end are used to educate the user on how to use the app. We used the built in blog features of Wordpress, along with a JSON API, to create posts that are consumed by Sidekick itself as a changelog/notification system. This proved really useful to give realtime notifications to the app, instead of having to push updates.
