      <h1>Creating Space</h1>
<article><p><img src="./creating-space-0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I think that <a href="http://www.jonathanmalm.com/">Jonathan Malm</a> from <a href="https://www.sundaymag.tv/">Sunday Magazine</a> (among other fames) and I have a good working relationship; He gives me challenging graphics with little direction, complete creative freedom, and tons of grace when I hand it off three days late (It's happened more than it should, and I think he plans for it now).</p>
<p>The title of the article (and magazine) for <a href="https://sundaymag.tv/18/">this month's Sunday Magazine</a> is &quot;Creating Space&quot;. There are a million directions one could go - workspaces (desks, cubicles, coffeeshops), production spaces (stages, backstage, FOH, rack spaces, stage sets), time (clocks, timelines) - all of which we could go with for the piece. But then, in Jon's email, this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The visual theme for the issue is…bum bum bum…space! :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Got it! Space! The final frontier! Beam me up! I'm a huge sci-fi buff, and I could do space graphics all day long. But, I and other readers of the magazine, can't create space, at least not in the literal sense. That is what God does. And there is no way I could do what He does. So I knew that I wanted something that was almost a spiritual journey for myself, meditating on how He created SPACE, and how I can only make a little mock-up.
To communicate the &quot;create&quot; part of the title, I wanted to physically, with my hands, &quot;create space&quot;.</p>
<p>The first thing I did, was find a box. I wanted something big and, well, spacious. I cut off the flaps and painted the inside flat black. You know, space.</p>
<p><img src="./creating-space-1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Using the physical size of the opening as a measurement, I opened up Adobe Illustrator and typed out the word &quot;Space&quot; in several different fonts that looked spacey. Then I changed the color to a medium grey and reversed them, and printed out the sheet on card stock.</p>
<p><img src="./creating-space-2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Why medium grey and backwards text? Great question. The medium grey is for two reasons: With the laser printer I have, if something is printed in pure black, the toner smears. I knew I wanted white paper in the end, so less toner on my hands was important. I also didn't want the black to show through the paper if I shined a light through it. I want a white glow. The Backwards text is because I am going to physically cut out the letters, I want them to be white, so if I cut with the white side down, flip when I'm done, I will have really clean lines and no eraser marks! Why card-stock? Because I need a paper that can withstand what I am about to do to it. It needs to have strength! I also marked the tops of the letters at the start. It would suck if I got done cutting the letters out, making the diorama, take the picture, only to realize that there is a subtle difference in the orientation of the letter 's'. Better to be safe than sorry. Then, I cut out the letters. I did the same, reversed with the word &quot;Creating&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="./creating-space-3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>For the Satellite, I google imaged satellites to get some inspiration. I designed a simple box in Illustrator, a crazy star-cone, and drew the eight solar panels. I printed them on grey and yellow construction paper and white cardstock and cut accordingly. For the construction I also used toothpicks, skewers (both Sharpie-d black), a small amount of tin foil (the square on top) and screen material (don't really know why I have that lying around :) ).</p>
<p><img src="./creating-space-4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I had some rolled balls of tin foil, spray painted grey as well to act as astroids, but they turned out a little cheesy, so they got cut!</p>
<p>The star field was a sheet of black poster-board that I stabbed with a few different sized nails. I guess I have a lot of pent up aggression, huh!</p>
<p><img src="./creating-space-5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally, I found a paper-craft model of a space shuttle online. I scaled it down with my printer, cut it out and built it.</p>
<p><img src="./creating-space-6.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Assembly was probably the most difficult. I ran fishing line across the box at varying depths, creating &quot;invisible&quot; clotheslines for the letters, word and circle to sit on. I made the ends of the fishing line held tight by the cut in the box, that way I could always pull the slack out or shift the lines, just in case. The shuttle and satellite were hung similarly, but hanging from the top, Christmas ornament style.</p>
<p>I set it up in my basement (which I'm remodeling, so pardon the mess), where I could control the light and noise since my wife and son were asleep! The front light was two IKEA LED desk lamps, while the backlight was a 300w video light (Mole Richardson Inbetweenie).
<img src="./creating-space-7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Then I photographed it!
One of the hardest things I'd found in this project was trying to create something fun that communicates space, but still show that it is all &quot;real&quot;. For instance, how black do you make the blacks of space?</p>
<p>Also, in real life you can move about the diorama, 'feeling' the 3D space. With a still, it looks like it's all on one plane! So I had to use light and a little Photoshop to enhance the depth.</p>
<p>In Photoshop my goal was to make it feel a little less like pile of trash and more like a fantastic universe, yet maintain the craftiness. Here is the before and after.</p>
<p><img src="./creating-space-8.jpg" alt="">
<img src="./creating-space-9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>There you have it. It was a ton of fun and cool to pray through. I think God did a better job, though, honestly! :)</p>
