<article><p>A few weeks ago I posted about <a href="/local-npm-packages" title="Local NPM Packages">local-npm-packages</a>.</p>
<p>While this is cool, one of the major drawbacks that I noted is that you can't share or collaborate with this. The package is completely local.</p>
<p>After that post I decided I need to post that package somewhere, but I'm not committed enough to needing a private npmjs subscription. I wanted to find out whether or not I can post that package on a server I already own. It turns out that the wonderful folks at npm have provided a way for this!
You can host a package a number of different ways and use npm to pull those packages, even from other sources.</p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">npm</span> i git+ssh://git@gitlab.com:organization/my-package<span class="token comment">#1.0.0 -D</span></code></pre>
<h2>Here are some pros to this:</h2>
<ol>
<li>It can be private or public, depending on the repo.</li>
<li>If you have free private repos then it's free!</li>
</ol>
<h2>...and the cons:</h2>
<ol>
<li>The semver distribution isn't as cool. It's using a git repo and not a package version, so you have to use tags to version your package. From what I can tell it's just not as polished.</li>
<li>npm has done a ton of amazing performance tricks to make npm sing. You don't get that out of the box whan you host it yourself on a git service. Which is totally fair. Their made to server</li>
<li>git, which is not npm packages!</li>
</ol>
