Even though I have seen the movie twice (and loved it) I thought I would give this a try.

A storm on Mars forces Mark Watney's team to abandon their mission and head back to Earth. In the chaos of the storm, Mark id blown away and his team presumes he's dead and leaves. He wakes up, injured and alone on Mars with no way to contact his team or Earth. He has to figure out how to survive and see if there is any way to make it back home.

The book is brilliant! Mark is witty and sarcastic. It was such a good ride. I literally could not put this book down.
