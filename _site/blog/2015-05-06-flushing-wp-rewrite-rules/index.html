<article><p>In all of my adventures yesterday in reworking the permalinks I ran into some caching issues. It took me a while to figure out that it <em>was</em> a caching issue. Anyway, I came across <a href="http://andrei-lupu.com/wordpress/dont-forget-to-flush-your-rewrite-rules/">this article</a> which tells how to flush the WP rewrite rules.</p>
<pre><code>/* I've lied to you, there are 2 solutions */

/* A function: */
flush_rewrite_rules();

// And a method of the global object $wp_rewrite
global $wp_rewrite;
$wp_rewrite-&gt;flush_rules();
</code></pre>
