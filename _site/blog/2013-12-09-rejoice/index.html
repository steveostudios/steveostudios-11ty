<article><p>My beautiful bride sent me this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! Let your gentleness be evident to all. The Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
<cite>-- Philippians 4:4-7</cite></p>
