<article><p>I just discovered <a href="https://sailsjs.org/">Sails.js</a>, a realtime MVC framework for Node.js.</p>
<p>To be honest, I am not even completely sure an MVC means (I know it means Model-View-Controller). I've spent hours reading nerdy-article after nerdy-article about MVC and the pros and cons, and how its so simple and whatnot. I understand that it is something I need to know, but my mind hasn't grasped it yet.</p>
<p>That all being said, I discovered Node because I wanted to do a project involving sockets, which, from my understanding can be done in almost any language, but Node developers seem to be talking non-stop about it. I also knew that I wanted an MVC for the framework of my node project. So I searched GitHub and really only found one guy who made an <a href="https://github.com/madhums/node-express-mongoose-demo">MVC framework for Node</a> that I could follow. What then transpired was 6 months of building an app that may one day see the light of day.</p>
<p>Then, the other day I discovered <a href="https://sailsjs.org/">Sails.js</a>. If you're interested, watch the video below.</p>

<p>I like that it has Express, <a href="https://socket.io/">Socket.io</a>, and the database already ready to go. I like that it has a ton of other features that I have heard of but have no idea what they do (yet!). I'm super stoked.</p>
