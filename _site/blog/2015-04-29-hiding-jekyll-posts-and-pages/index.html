<article><p>You can set a Jekyll page or post to be hidden by adding <code>published: false</code> to the front matter.</p>
<p>Super easy!</p>
<p>The post/page will not go through the generator, so it's not live anywhere (you can't preview it).</p>
<p>I did find that if you want to preview a <em>page</em> without it adding the link to the site header you can add <code>hide: true</code> to the front matter. Although, I'm not sure yet if this is specific only to my theme or if it's a Jekyll standard.</p>
