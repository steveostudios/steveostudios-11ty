## Overview

Ready, Set, Go! was our third and ended up being the final app we built at Digital Stache. It's a simple countdown maker. You can set the time and choose a theme. It had a few other tricks as well. Ready, Set, Go! was free because we wanted people to see how easy it was and try our other games.

## Behind the Scenes

Like [Spin That Wheel](/projects/spin-that-wheel), [Score Keep](/projects/score-keep), Ready, Set, Go! was developed in Adobe Flex and distributed on DVD-ROM and online. Being free, I commented out all of the registration code stuff, and I had already built the countdown bit for Score Keep. This was just a repackage that could hopefully help youth workers with a common task -- countdowns!
