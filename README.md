# Steveostudios.com Portfolio site

This is the personal portfolio for me, Steve Stone. I'm a designer, developer, and youth worker. You can find out more about me at [this site](https://steveostudios.com).

- [Books](https://steveostudios.com/books): What I have read and what I am reading.
- [Projects](https://steveostudios.com/projects): UI design and development projects I have gotten to work on.
- [Blog](https://steveostudios.com/blog): Mostly outdated blog, but an interesting slice of history.
- [About](https://steveostudios.com/): A little about who I am, how I think, and where I have been
- [Resume](https://steveostudios.com/resume): just in case!

## Behind the scenes

This site is built on Eleventy. I use JSON files for the About, Books, and Resume data. The blog and projects are all handled with markdown files.

The book section is pretty fun and I update it usually once a week with where I am in my reading. I also wrote a [CLI](https://github.com/steveostudios/steveostudios-cli) to help me quickly update my site!
