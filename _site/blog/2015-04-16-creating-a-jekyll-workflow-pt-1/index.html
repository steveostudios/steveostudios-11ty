<article><p>As a designer (aka programming noob), I want to create a workflow that simplifies some of the things that writing in Jekyll requires. I don't write in vim, I still have a conceptually hard time with git, and terminal still freaks me out. I wanted a workflow were I get the benefits of Jekyll, but with a designer mentality.
That said, starting terminal, finding the directory, running Jekyll and serving up localhost in my browser seems like it could be simplified (programmers are lazy, right?). So I set out to write a script to do this for me.</p>
<p>I had trouble with just one script, so I actually wrote two, one cueing the other. These are just text files with the <code>.command</code> file extension. The first one I called <code>JekyllServe.command</code>.</p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token builtin class-name">cd</span> /path/to/site/folder<br>jekyll serve</code></pre>
<p>(you can see where the creative name came from, right?)</p>
<p>All it does is start the server. Simple, right? When you double click this it opens up terminal and executes those two lines. I could have stopped here, but I also wanted to open up Chrome as well, to <code>http://localhost:4000</code>.</p>
<p>The second script I called <code>LocalStartup.command</code>. This is the one I will generally double-click when I am ready to start writing a post or edit my local copy of the site.</p>
<pre class="language-shell"><code class="language-shell"><span class="token function">open</span> /path/to/JekyllServe.command<br><span class="token function">sleep</span> <span class="token number">2</span><br><span class="token function">open</span> http://localhost:4000<br><span class="token builtin class-name">exit</span> <span class="token number">0</span></code></pre>
<p>This is the actual &quot;app&quot; that I run. As you can see, when you double-click this it will first run the jekyll serve command from <code>JekyllServe.command</code>, then wait 2 second (for the server to finish starting), then open your browser to <code>http://localhost:4000</code>.</p>
<p>I'm going to continue to perfect this later, like add a &quot;publish&quot; command, and hopefully knock this down to one file, but as of right now, here it is!</p>
