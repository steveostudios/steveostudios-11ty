## Overview

We did a test during the sunmmer of 2021 to see what youth workers see how youth workers would submit their ideas and whether or not offering them for free would work. We wanted to know how many people would be interested in submitting, what kinds of ideas we would get, and how we could filter the submissions with contextual data. Ultimately we got some good feedback but the idea didn't really take off.

## Behind the Scenes

This uses Wordpress, but because we wanted to collect additional context and data, we ended up using Advanced Customn Fields, WS Form so anyone can submit post ideas, and Search & Filter to do the advanced filtering.
