This book was a ton of fun. I had initially thought that since it was made into a movie that it might be too mainstream or fluffy. After a few recommendations I gave it a shot and dang.

I will try not to spoil anything here. I loved the dystopian future (I'm a sucker for those stories). As a developer I loved the technical/computer aspects. And as a child of the 80's I loved the culture and references. I often found myself quoting as I was reading or recalling some deep-seeded memory of the forgotten past.

It was fun. Definitely recommend!
